    <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought 
       marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without 
       sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, 
       but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from 
       scratch. If that's the case for you, try out our best homemade 
       spaghetti sauce—simple in ingredients and rich in flavor, it'll 
       never let you down. </p>
    <p>Regardless of the route you choose to go down, make sure to follow 
       these tips—We've reworked this recipe based on user comments to m
       ake it even better with more meat, more sauce, and more cheese!</p>
